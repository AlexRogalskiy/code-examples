# USGS - National Water Information System 

The USGS web services for water-quality data are interoperable with corresponding web services provided by the US Environmental Protection Agency.

The main purpose of the Plugin is to pull data from a USGS Water Quality API, which you can read about here [USGS Water REST Service](https://waterservices.usgs.gov/rest/), using the site code and the sensor parameters.
